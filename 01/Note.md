To make my Project require less space in mongodb atlas database
What i can do is, i can create a localhost website that daily extract all data from database and put it in my local mongodb compas, or just a simple excel sheet.. Where i can study on those details locally
There will be no need to free a lot of spaces on mongodb atlas
